# Installation
You will need to have copies of your code on your local system. Here's how to do that.
## Clone This Repository

First you need a local copy of `interview-Project`. Run the following command in the directory of choice on your local system.

```
git clone https://github.com/ahLfyreD/Backend-NFTing-Edu-Website
```

This will download a local copy of `interview-project` in that directory.

## Change Directory into the Cloned Repo

Right after cloning the repo you can change the directory of your current `terminal(shell)` to the root directory of cloned repository using this command:

```
cd interview-Project
```

**NOTE:** `All the commands we're going to execute in the following instructions will assume you are in the root directory of the cloned interview-Project project. If you fail to do so, the commands will not work.`

# Installing required packages/dependencies

If you've followed the previous steps you should have already set up node.js on your system.
Run the following command to install the packages and dependencies required by `interview Project`:

```
npm install
```

# run-the-application

npm run dev
```
